# High-School-Final-Project-3
Final project created at the end of my AP CS class in high school. It is almost completely unmodified. This project is fully functional; however it lacks all of the characters I wanted to add to the project. At this point in time, I did not know how to do J-unit tests. data structures beyond arrays, good class design. throw Exceptions, and much more. Will be uploading for nostalgia and files will never be updated.
