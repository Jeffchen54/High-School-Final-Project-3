# High-School-Final-Project-3-2019
Final project created at the end of my AP CS class in high school. It is almost completely unmodified. This project is fully functional; however it lacks all of the characters I wanted to add to the project. At this point in time, I did not know how to do J-unit tests. data structures beyond arrays, good class design. throw Exceptions, and much more. Will be uploading for nostalgia and files will never be updated.

The mainClass.java is not the main class!!! It is actually the test.java that is the main class. Git solves the issue of backups like this; however, I did not know what git was. A music file was unable to be uploaded; however, the main class does not use the music. Music use was only tested in music.java. 

Was ran and created on jGRASP, not the fancy eclipse that my college uses now.
